# Excel Portfolio

This repository has a collection of Excel projects to show my skills in data analysis, dashboards, and problem solving. These projects are useful for data analyst internships and Excel-related jobs.

Skills covered in these projects:
- Cleaning and organizing data
- Using formulas like VLOOKUP, SUMIFS, and INDEX-MATCH
- Creating Pivot Tables and Charts
- Making dashboards to show key information
- Analyzing data and finding insights

These projects are small exercises that help me practice real-world tasks for  analyst roles.
